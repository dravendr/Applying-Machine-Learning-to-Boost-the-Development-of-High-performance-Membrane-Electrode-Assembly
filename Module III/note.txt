databaseML.csv and database.csv are the same database, the only difference is that we removed some 
of the special characters in feature names in database.csv because we used supercomputer clusters to 
conduct part of the jobs and found some incompatible errors. And we have to change part of the feature
names by removing characters like'℃' or ‘%’
